## Introduction

This project aims to build a comprehensive AI communication platform. The goal is to create an AI agent that goes beyond simple text chat by integrating a virtual mailbox system and a Virtual Reality (VR) interface.

The core idea is to give the AI the ability to check its own "email" and interact with the user in a more immersive environment.

## Key Features

1.  **AI Communication**:
    - Powered by LLM APIs (requires an API Key).
    - Capable of intelligent conversation and logic processing.

2.  **Virtual Mailbox System**:
    - The AI has access to a virtual email account.
    - It can read, process, and respond to simulated emails stored in the system.

3.  **Virtual Reality (VR) Interface**:
    - A visual platform for user-AI interaction (WIP).
    - Moves away from the traditional command-line interface to a more immersive experience.
